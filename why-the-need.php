<h1>Why is it so important to have an Open Source liturgy?</h1>
</div>

<p class = "first">
I have been asked on numerous occasions why go through
all the work to prepare a properly Open Source liturgy
when there already are already plenty of liturgies out
there.
The answer is that while there are several liturgies
out there that you can buy a copy of in a store (or
order a copy online) or even download from the Internet,
there is something missing from all of these.
Anyone can get ahold of a copy of those liturgies.
In some cases "anyone" means "anyone who can afford to pay"
- but others are free-of-charge, and therefore don't
have that limitation.

Why do I say "free-of-charge" rather than "free"?
This is not just a linguistic quirk, but
is actually critical to the reason why this project is
needed.
It is that while many of these resources are free
in the sense of one definition of the word "free",
there is another very critical definition of the word
"free" that these resources do not meet
- that being "free" in the sense of, well, actual freedom.
Of course, I needn't spend too many words here explaining
exactly what this means because the Free Software Foundation
has <a href = "<?php rmt_link_out('define_free_software'); ?>" target = "_blank">
a perfectly good document to explain what exactly this is</a>.
Instead, I shall devote the bulk of this article to explaining
why it is oh so important to have liturgical resources
that are free in this sense of the word.

Ultimately, the reasons why it is important to have
liturgical resources that are free in the sense of
actual freedom include both reasons that are purely
theological as well as reasons that are pastoral.
While the purely theological reasons are indeed
important and need to be discussed as well,
the focus of this document is on the pastoral
need for libre liturgical resources
("libre" meaning "free" in the sense of actual freedom).

In Jesus's ministry and teaching, one thing He
made absolutely clear
is the requirement that His followers stand up and
defend marginalized members of society.
Unfortunately, though, the main institutional
Catholic Church all too often betrays
this mission - not just by neglecting it,
but at times, by actively opposing it.
Many groups of people who are to varying
degrees marginalized by society,
people who should be able to find
a safe haven in the Church,
often find additional marginalization
instead.
The rhetoric dished out by too many people
in positions of ecclesiastical authority
is emotionally abusive of LGBT people
in the Church who as a result have to
make the dire choice
between submitting to even more emotional
abuse from the pulpit or not receiving
sacraments at all (unless the
authorities make that decision for them by
deciding to withhold communion
by invoking <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_915" target = "_blank"
>Canon 915</a>).
Furthermore, the hierarchy of the institutional
church has worked very hard on opposing
so many efforts for society to extend to
LGBT people basic rights and privileges that
other people take for granted.
As a matter of fact Bishop Robert Lynch
had quite a point,
after the recent tragedy in Orlando,
when he <a href = "<?php rmt_link_out('bishop-lynch-on-orlando'); ?>" target = "_blank">pointed out how the Church's breeding of contempt for LGBT people
is a factor behind anti-LGBT violence</a>.

The institutional Church's marginalization
of groups of people whom the Church aught
to be protecting is not limited to those
on the LGBT spectrum.
People suffering from celiac disease
and other severe gluten intolerances
are placed in a position where
they have to risk their health to
receive communion,
all due to a stubborn insistence that
"bread" be interpreted in a way that
requires that it be made out of wheat.
Even divorced and remarried Catholics are
generally barred from receiving communion
unless their previous marriages have been
annulled - which is in itself
a problematic requirement for many.
