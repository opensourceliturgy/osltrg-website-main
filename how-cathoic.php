<p class = "first">
The term &quot;Refugant Catholic&quot; is coined in order to refer to
something that exists outside the jurisdiction of any of the mainstream
Catholic churches - and even beyond the Old Catholic churches.
It refers to a small trend on the fringes of even the
Independent Catholic movement, fiercely inclusive of groups whom the
institutional Church has failed (including but not limited to people in the LGBT spectrum)
who's sacramental ministers may or may-not even be ordained through the
episcopal pedigree of Apostolic Succession.

This brief explanation of what Refugant Catholicism is may have many
people scratching their heads in disbelief.
After all, it is generally understood that
the Apostolic Succession of all clergy is
supposedly one of the few things that all Catholic churches,
even the most unconventional of the Independent Catholic churches,
all have in common.
For this reason, some people might think that those of us
driven out of the mainstream Catholic Church should either
find an Independent Catholic church with Apostolic Succession,
just do without the sacraments until such an Independent Catholic
jurisdiction is available in the area,
or just accept that we've crossed the line between Catholicism
and Protestantism.
A few might even be so unscrupulous as to suggest
that we should go back to the mainstream Catholic churches
and continue to subject ourselves to more of the marginalization
and abuse that drove us out to begin with.
But most would assert that it is quite curious how
those of us who have fled, who have not found a safe-haven community
with Apostolic Succession, and who nonetheless celebrate
the Sacraments anyway, identify ourselves as "Catholic"
rather than as "Protestant".
</p>

<p class = "more">
The first part of the answer involves the reason why we
are separated from the mainstream Catholic churches in
the first place.
As is evident from the fact that the word "Refugant"
is clearly a derivation of the word "Refugee" -
our motives for leaving were not about questions
of abstract theology
or anything like that.
Rather, we fled because the mistreatment we endured
in those churches was more than we could continue to
bear.
For many of us it is no exaggeration to say that
this had become a matter of life-and-death -
and leaving was what we had to do for our survival:
be it physical survival, spiritual survival, or both.

Some of us may not have all the traits that make a community
recognizable as "Catholic" - but those traits that
we no longer retain were not discarded willingly
as can be said about Protestants.
Rather, in our case, they were jettisoned - discarded
only upon the clear realization that refusing to let
go of those signatures of Catholicism would very soon
result in our whole ship sinking and us losing
everything that made us Catholic.
</p>

<p class = "more">
And yes - in some cases, one of the signatures of
Catholicism that we had to let go of is the insistence
that our sacramental ministers must be ordained through
the episcopal pedigree of Apostolic Succession.
We couldn't receive the Sacraments without letting
go of this insistence because the abuse endured in the
only places where we could
receive the Sacraments without letting go of this
insistence was just too much.
We also couldn't just keep on going without receiving
the Sacraments at all - because the Sacraments are
the ultimate tangible expression of God's love for
us, and in our situations such expression of God's love
is needed more than ever.

Of course, I could discuss here the
<a href = "<?php rmt_link_out('church_and_ministry'); ?>" target = "_blank">arguments
made by the Dutch Dominicans on why it is in deed possible, albeit at last-resort</a>
- or I could discuss the inescapable implications of the
man whom the Apostles complained to Jesus about who was casting
out demons in Jesus's name
(Luke 9:49-50 / Mark 9:38-41) - or maybe Jesus's explanation of how even
we who are sinful know better than to give our child a rock when he asks for bread
or a snake when he asks for food (Matthew 7:9-11 / Luke 11:11-13) -- but I won't go into
detail here about any of these things.
The reason for this is simple: While all these arguments present an
amazingly airtight argument for the validity of Refugant Catholicism -
this document is not about the our validity, but about our Catholicity.
Therefore, I will try to stick to explaining the reasons why we identify
as Catholic rather than get side-tracked by explaining the
basis of our validity.
</p>

<p class = "more">
Though many of us celebrate the Sacraments without Apostolic Succession -
many of us long for the day that Apostolic Succession is restored to our
communities.
Some of us might say otherwise - but I strongly suspect that such
cases are examples of how "I don't care" is code for "I've given up on
it ever happening".
However - as much as we would gladly have Apostolic Succession restored,
we can not go back to claiming that there are no situations in which
Sacraments celebrated without it are valid and Catholic -- because to
do so would be to betray those who are in situations that we will
have once ourselves been in - and ultimately would be a betrayal of Christ
Himself.
