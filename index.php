<p class = "first">
Welcome to this Open Source liturgy project.
Of course, this isn't the only Open Source liturgy project.
<a href = "<?php rmt_link_out('methodist-project'); ?>" target = "_blank">There
exists another Open Source liturgy project - but the other one is more Methodist
in nature</a>.
This one, however, is more from a Catholic perspective - though it is not
from within any of the churches under Rome's control.
It isn't even from within the mainstream of the so-called "Independent Catholic"
movement which consists of churches that, while independent from control
by the Vatican, nonetheless share many traits with them, including
all seven sacraments,
as well as Apostolic Succession by an understanding that implies
that all of their clergy are properly ordained from the episcopal pedigree.

This site is still under development.
However, you can already <a href = "missal.php" target = "_blank">view the
date-generic form of the missal</a>
-- and you can also <a href = "why-the-need.php">read the page
about why this project is important</a>.
