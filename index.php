Welcome to this Open Source liturgy project.
Of course, this isn't the only Open Source liturgy project.
<a href = "<?php rmt_link_out('methodist-project'); ?>" target = "_blank">There
exists another Open Source liturgy project - but the other one is more Methodist
in nature</a>.
This one, however, is more from a Catholic perspective - though it is not
from within any of the churches under Rome's control.
It isn't even from within the mainstream of the so-called "Independent Catholic"
movement which consists of churches that, while independent from control
by the Vatican, nonetheless share many traits with them, including
all seven sacraments,
as well as Apostolic Succession by an understanding that implies
that all of their clergy are properly ordained from the episcopal pedigree.
Rather, this is from the perspective of a small trend on the fringes
of even the Independent Catholic movement,
fiercely inclusive of groups whom the institutional Church has failed
(including but not limited to people in the LGBT spectrum)
who's sacramental ministers may or may-not even be ordained
through the fore-mentioned pedigree.

Upon learning that the sacramental ministers in this small, Emergent movement
may or may-not be ordained through the episcopal pedigree, some might
ask, "Doesn't that make you Protestant rather than Catholic?".
The short answer is -- no, it doesn't,
and eventually there are plans to add explanations to this site
as to why it doesn't.
However, for the time being, there are other things that
are receiving prior attention.
Yet do not be concerned - as an explanation as to why we
still consider ourselves to still be Catholic rather than Protestant
is on the to-do list.
